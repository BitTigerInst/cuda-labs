Question:
In your kernel implementation of tiled matrix multiplication, how many threads
can be simultaneously scheduled for execution on a GeForce GTX-680 GPU, which
contains 8 SMs?


Answer:
In our kernel implementation, we use tile with size of 32 by 32, so there will be
1024 threads in one block. Since only 2048 threads are allowed in one SM in
GTX-680, one SM could only have 2 blocks of 1024 threads.
If there are 8 SMs in GTX-680, then the number of the threads can be
simultaneously scheduled is:
8 * (2 * 32 * 32) = 16384
